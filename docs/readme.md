## First Steps

Grasping all the concepts around a product such as Front-Commerce is exciting, but can be intimidating.
We tried to create and organize this documentation in a way that you could quickly find the information you need depending on your context.

We recommend to first have a running instance of Front-Commerce Lite locally, it will allow you to experiment as you read.

Start with our [Getting started documentation page](getting-started.md).
